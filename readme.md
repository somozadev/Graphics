# **Somine Engine ðŸŽ®ðŸš€**

<br />
Somine Engine is a lightweight renderer engine built using OpenGL and C++, designed to provide hands-on experience in real-time graphics programming. This project is a part of my learning journey with OpenGL, focusing on creating a flexible and performant engine for rendering 3D graphics. Once the renderer is in a good state, will mutate into a game engine.
<br /><br />

## ðŸ›  Features
<br />
Real-Time 3D Rendering: Built on top of OpenGL for high-performance graphics.
Custom Shader Support: Load and manage custom vertex, fragment, and geometry shaders.
Lighting & Shadows: Supports directional, point, and spotlights, currenty implementing shadows.
Model Loading: Uses Assimp for importing models in various formats (e.g., .obj, .fbx).
Camera System: Easy-to-use camera controls (FPS & free-look modes).
Materials & Textures: Supports diffuse, specular, and normal mapping.
<br /><br />

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
<br />
Prerequisites
<br />
C++17 or higher<br />
OpenGL 3.3<br />
GLFW & GLAD for window management and OpenGL functions<br />
Assimp for model loading <br />
CMake for project building<br />
<br /><br />
Installation
<br />
git clone https://github.com/somozadev/Graphics.git<br />
cd Somine Engine/Somine/Somine.sln<br />
<br /><br />

## ðŸŽ® Controls
<br />
WASD: Move camera<br />
Mouse 2: Look around<br />
<br /><br />

## ðŸ–¼ TODO List
<br />
 Implement deferred rendering<br />
 Mutate from renderer to game engine<br />
 Implement particle systems<br />
